# "Step Flow" Project Development Plan

## 1. Overall Vision and Project Goals

### 1.1. Vision
To create an innovative multi-agent system, "Step Flow," with intuitive voice control and a powerful workflow builder. The system should allow users to easily automate complex processes, create and configure AI agents, and manage them through a web interface and a PWA application. "Step Flow" aims to become a leader in personalized AI solutions for automation.

### 1.2. Key Goals
*   Develop a multifunctional platform with voice control (Speech-to-Speech).
*   Implement a workflow builder based on `react-flow` for creating and managing multi-agent systems.
*   Provide the ability to generate custom agents, rules, instructions, and MCPs.
*   Create a neomorphic black-and-white UI/UX with micro-animations and a unique animated preloader.
*   Ensure high performance, scalability, and reliability of the system.
*   Release the product to production with a team of specialized AI agents.
*   Provide users with the ability to create and manage their personal workflow instances in a cloud infrastructure.

## 2. Detailed Technology Stack

### 2.1. Frontend
*   **Web Application**: React, TypeScript.
*   **PWA/Mobile Application**: React Native, TypeScript.
*   **Styling and UI**: Neomorphic design (black-and-white color scheme), CSS-in-JS (e.g., Styled Components) or Tailwind CSS (adapted for neomorphism).
*   **Animations**: Micro-animations (Framer Motion or React Spring), ASAP SVG for the preloader.
*   **State Management**: Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or Recoil.
*   **Workflow Builder**: `react-flow`.
*   **Build Tools**: Webpack/Vite for React, Metro for React Native.

### 2.2. Backend

*   **Database (Primary)**: PostgreSQL (for relational data, agent configurations, workflows).
*   **Database (Cache/Messaging)**: Redis (for caching, session management, possibly as a message broker for agents).
*   **Authentication/Authorization**: OAuth 2.0 / JWT.
*   **API**: RESTful API and/or GraphQL.

    *   **Option 2 (Long-term/Custom)**: Development of a custom lightweight core in Python for full control and optimization for project needs, if ready-made solutions prove insufficiently flexible.
*   **Inter-agent Communication**: Redis Pub/Sub or RabbitMQ/Kafka (if more complex routing and delivery guarantees are needed).
*   **Storage of Agent Configurations and Instructions**: PostgreSQL or specialized configuration files (YAML/JSON), managed via API.

### 2.5. DevOps

## 7. Development Pipeline for "Step Flow"

### 7.1. Adaptation of Existing Pipeline
The existing pipeline from [`./.roo/pipeline.md`](./.roo/pipeline.md) is a good foundation. For "Step Flow," it will be adapted as follows:
*   **Task Definition**: Tasks will be specific to "Step Flow," may include UI development, backend logic, voice features, agent modules.
*   **Analysis and Decomposition**: `SF_Architect`, `SF_ProjectManager`, `SF_Orchestrator` will perform this role.
*   **Development**: `SF_Developer` agents (Web, PWA, Backend) will perform development.
*   **Testing**: `SF_QA` will conduct testing, including specific tests for voice interface, PWA, multi-agent scenarios.
*   **Code Review**: `SF_LeadDeveloper`, other `SF_Developer` agents, `SF_Architect`.
*   **Build and Deployment**: `SF_DevOps` will manage CI/CD via GitHub Actions for deployment to Docker/Kubernetes.

### 7.2. Specific Aspects for "Step Flow"
*   **Design Review**: Before starting UI component development, `SF_UI_Designer` must approve mockups.
*   **Voice Interface Testing**: Specific methodologies and possibly tools will be needed for testing STT/TTS and command understanding.
*   **PWA/Mobile Testing**: Testing on various devices and platforms.
*   **Multi-agent Scenario Testing**: Development of complex integration tests to verify agent interactions within workflows.
*   **Agent Configuration Management**: Process for updating and versioning agent instructions and rules.

## 8. Proposals and Remarks

### 8.1. Potential Risks
*   **Integration Complexity**: A large number of technologies (voice, multi-agent, React Native, Kubernetes) can lead to integration difficulties.
*   **Voice Service Performance**: Delays in Whisper or ElevenLabs operation can negatively affect UX.
*   **Speech Recognition and Synthesis Quality**: Dependence on external STT/TTS services.
*   **Difficulty in Debugging Multi-agent Systems**: Debugging interactions between multiple agents can be non-trivial.
*   **Selection and Training of AI Agent Team**: Configuring and training such a large number of specialized agents will require time and resources.
*   **Neomorphic Design**: Although striking, it can be complex to implement and ensure accessibility.
*   **Cloud Infrastructure Management**: Kubernetes requires expertise for setup and maintenance.

### 8.2. Additional Proposals
*   **Iterative Development of Voice Assistant**: Start with a limited set of commands and gradually expand its capabilities.
*   **Modular Architecture of Multi-agent Core**: Design the core so that new agent types and data sources can be easily added.
*   **Focus on User Experience (UX)**: Especially for the workflow builder and voice control. Conduct regular UX testing.
*   **Creation of a "Sandbox" for Workflow Developers**: A place where users can safely experiment with creating and testing their agents and workflows.
*   **Consider Using Feature Flags**: For gradual rollout of new features and A/B testing.

## 9. Updating Existing Documentation and Configurations

### 9.1. Updating Global Documents (in `.roo/`)
*   [`./.roo/roles.md`](./.roo/roles.md): General principles for naming project-specific roles (e.g., `PROJECT_` prefix) can be added.
*   [`./.roo/pipeline.md`](./.roo/pipeline.md): A section on how to adapt the pipeline for large sub-projects like "Step Flow" can be added.

### 9.2. Creating Specific Documents for "Step Flow" (in `step_flow/.roo/`)
*   **`step_flow/.roo/roles.md`**: Detailed description of all `SF_...` agents, their responsibilities, tools, and interactions (as in section 4 of this plan).
*   **`step_flow/.roo/development_guidelines.md`**:
    *   Specific guidelines for React Native (code style, working with native modules).
    *   Guidelines for FastAPI (project structure, working with Pydantic models, asynchronous programming).
    *   Naming conventions for components in neomorphic UI.
    *   Guidelines for writing instructions for AI agents.
*   **`step_flow/.roo/modes/`**: JSON configuration files for each `SF_...` agent.

### 9.3. MCP Configuration (`step_flow/.roo/mcp.json`)
*   Create the file [`step_flow/.roo/mcp.json`](step_flow/.roo/mcp.json).
*   It can define MCP servers specific to "Step Flow," if any are needed. For example:
    *   A wrapper around the ElevenLabs API if complex logic or caching is required.
    *   Custom MCPs for integration with internal project services.
    *   If the Jira Tasks API is used via MCP, its configuration could also be here.
    *   For now, it can be left empty or with a placeholder, as direct integration with Whisper/ElevenLabs/Jira Tasks APIs can be implemented directly in the code of the respective agents or backend services. The need for MCPs for them will arise if a standardized interface for multiple agents or complex preprocessing is required.
