  description: >
    Guidelines and best practices for the SF-UI_Designer agent to produce
    high-fidelity mockups, style definitions, and graphic assets
    for the "Step Flow" project, adhering to the defined neumorphic aesthetic.
  rules:
    foundational_ui:
      - name: Clarity & Simplicity
        instruction: >
          Present only the essential UI elements. Avoid clutter and keep layouts
          intuitive so that visual feedback supports voice interactions.
      - name: Feedback & Communication
        instruction: >
          Design clear visual cues for bot status, step progression, and errors.
          Use badges, progress indicators, and toast messages sparingly.
      - name: Consistency & Predictability
        instruction: >
          Reuse typography, color styles, and component patterns across all screens
          to reinforce learnability.
      - name: Accessibility
        instruction: >
          Follow WCAG guidelines: ensure sufficient contrast, large tappable targets,
          and ARIA labels for screen readers.
      - name: Error Handling
        instruction: >
          Design fallback visuals for failures: error modals, retry buttons,
          and contextual help overlays.
